# Android Wake On UWB App


## Overview
Our project aims to leverage the advantages of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) on a mobile phone. When the mobile phone puts its WiFi to sleep and keeps UWB awake, WiFi can be reactivated by receiving UWB messages from an access point. To achieve this functionality, we intend to develop a UWB listening app for the Android phone. Given that UWB has emerged as a transformative technology, offering distinct advantages over conventional technologies, our project is poised to have a significant impact on the utilization of UWB on mobile phones. Furthermore, its capabilities can certainly be extended to achieve other useful functions such as phone localization.
